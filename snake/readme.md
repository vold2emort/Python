# snake Game
This snake game is created using oop and turtle module in python all the square shape of turtle module is used as object to create snake in which each object follows other one .The score bord is also a turtle objected. I used turtle module from https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html  

added high score tracking even after the program is stopped. Try to beat the high score if you can.
